        "Getting the transcript for the YouTube video and downloading it on my device was relatively easy with the clear instructions that were provided. Actually grabbing the transcript and parsing it down to make it cleaner went well. There were a few errors I got when I first started running code cells related to the name of my API key I was trying to assign as a variable. I just looked up \"Python variable name error google colab\" in my search engine and was able to find a Google colab file that quickly goes over allowed variable names. This allowed me to fix my problem (I didn't put \"\" around the variable) easily, although I did feel a bit silly for not catching the error myself. I had some issues creating the lab 1 folder in my github repository and uploading the transcript to it. I had to read a couple of comments on different forums and some basic webpages to understand. I also ended up asking my coworker and friend who went through Atlas school in Tulsa about Github and she was able to give me a few pointers that I would have spent a lot longer figuring out on my own if I wasn't able to ask her."
