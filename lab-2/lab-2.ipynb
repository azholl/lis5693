I didn't think about how the video had YouTube auto captions on, and how that would make the transcript data very messy. There were names of characters and items that were said frequently but spelled a different way almost every time. This meant that there were over 250 NERs (which I counted by hand because I couldn't figure out how to make the model tell me how many there were) and many of them were repeats of the same word, just spelled a different way. It wasn't necessarily a challenge, but it did make me think more about preprocessing when it comes to mining large amounts of text that would probably be messy, and how important it is to make sure I'm critical about my preprocessing decisions."
